I’m planning to prevent shark attacks in the state of Florida. I have a dataset reporting ≈950 shark attack events. At first glance, important features include: location, date, activity, gender, age and time. I’m hoping to pull in additional features based off the location and date. For example, ocean water temperature, wave height, air temperature, fishing volume and precipitation amount. I know that this will start as an unsupervised clustering problem, in that I’ll need to see if there are groupings of shark attacks that provoke a deeper yearning to learn more. I also know that there are more days without a shark attack, than there are with one. And many of the days without one, may have very similar attributes to the days that do. As a result, it may turn out to be difficult to turn this into a supervised classification algorithm in predicting shark attack probabilities. However, I chose this topic because I’m fascinated with the ocean and how there isn’t more easily accessible data around events like this.
